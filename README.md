#Braid

This is one half of braid whereby this express service is for modifying data.

Braid is a service which allows users to add threads of content from their favorite services apply a type of modifier to it to add extra functionality it didn't have before. This is then all made available through api endpoints that will serve up the original data plus the data the user modified on to it as JSON.

For a more detailed explanation and documentation please look at the [wiki](http://github.com/birdyboy18/braid-management/wiki).

I've also included a [public trello board](https://trello.com/b/fJbSQhHB/braid) so that people can see what features are currently being implemented. Please understand this trello board is for the entire project not just for this part of braid.
